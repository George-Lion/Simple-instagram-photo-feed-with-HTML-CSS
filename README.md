The objective of this exercise was to make an Instagram-style image feed, the knowledge
applied for the same child:

-Display and Position CSS rules.
-Build a layout with CSS/HTML.
-Reuse CSS classes
-Center containers.
-Flow left and right.
-Import images.

Each of the areas is divided into <div> to get control over the containers,
in this way the content within them will be individual, allowing their versatility by
time to apply the corresponding css properties. Dividing each area we apply the
properties to build a layout of the positions they will occupy
each <div> in our visual space, finally the content that will occupy each <div> is added
in which the tags <h1>, <p>, <img>, etc. will be reflected.

## What to do next?

Create an `index.html` file with the [basic HTML structure](http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/what-is-html-learn-html#page-structure) and see it live by running a web-server using the following command:

```sh
$ pip3 install flask && python3 server.py
```

- You can create as many HTML files as you want
- You can also create CSS files and import them into your website using a `<link>` tag placed between the `<head></head>` tags, like this:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
  ...
</head>
```
